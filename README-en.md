# Recursive Power Program

This repo contains the code for the "Recursive Power" program developed in Java.

---

## Description

The "Recursive Power" program calculates the power of a number using recursion. It prompts the user to enter a base value and an exponent value. It then uses a recursive method called `power` to calculate the result. The `power` method recursively multiplies the base value by itself, decrementing the exponent value by 1 in each recursion, until the exponent becomes 0.

## Usage

1. Download or clone the project files to your computer.
2. Open the `RecursivePower.java` file using a Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or a text editor.
3. Compile and run the `RecursivePower.java` file.
4. The program will prompt you to enter the base value and the exponent value.
5. After entering the values, the program will calculate and display the result on the screen.
